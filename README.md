# DailyProjects

My goal is to make a new program everyday. When I do not have an assignemnt to complete my goal I will write a program here. These projects will usually be short (at most a few hundred lines) and be ideas of my own or suggestions from the internet.

### Day 1 RPN Evaluation (March 18)
 I learned about RPN (Reverse Polish Notation) from my Java class. 
It is a way to evaluate functions with multiple operands in a simple manner. 
The way it works is with stacks. 
The program goes through every item in the function and if it gets a number it puts it on the stack, if it is an operand, it does the operation on the last two items in the stack and pushes the result on the stack. 
The final result is when there is one item on the stack.
I made my own stack structure (which I have never done before) and got more familiar with switch statements.
The program will tell you if you put an item that is not a number or operator.
It will only not print a result and say "Something went wrong" when there is more than one item one the stack when done evaluating.
For more information on how to write RPN statements visit the wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation
